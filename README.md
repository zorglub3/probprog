# Probabilistic Programming in Scala

This is my exploration of probabilistic programming in Scala. This implemented as
a an embedded domain specific language in Scala. Several inference algorithms have
been implemented for this DSL and more will come. The implementation has several
goals:

1. Learn about probabilistic programming and what problems it can solve; and,
2. Find out what inference algorithms work best for what problems and programs; and,
3. Explore deep learning in the context of probabilistic programming and how it
   relates to building models for artificial intelligence.

## Work in Progress

- An importance sampling inference module.
- Deep learning using stochastic gradient descent. Using the reverse mode 
  automatic differentiation to find gradients.
- More examples...
